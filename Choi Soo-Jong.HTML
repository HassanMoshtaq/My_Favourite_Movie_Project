<h3> Career </h3>
<hr />
<p> When reflecting on his more than twenty years as an actor, Choi said "To an actor, fame is short, but acting is long."</p>
<p> As a public figure and social activist, Choi Soo-jong has sought to project an image of integrity and wholesomeness. His fidelity to his wife and dedication to his role as father and husband are widely discussed in the media, although he strives to retain his family's privacy. Choi also openly discusses his commitment to clean living through regular exercise and healthy eating. Despite his advancing age, Choi continues to accept physically challenging roles that require horseback riding, combat and swordsmanship, and exposure to extreme temperatures. His youthful appearance and physical fitness allow Choi to play characters much younger than his actual age.</p>
<p> Despite Choi's image of integrity and health, in 2007 his career was briefly overshadowed by scandal. In a series of news stories, it was revealed that several high-profile Korean actors had falsified their academic credentials. Choi was among those whose educational background on his resume proved to be exaggerated and included untrue information.[1][2] Choi tearfully apologized for misleading the public.</p>
<p> In 2010, Choi was cast in a lead role in Legend of the Patriots, a remake of the 1975 series Comrades. According to a press release from KBS, Choi found acting in a war drama even more challenging than the historical dramas he is known for. When asked why he chose to pursue the challenging genre of war drama, Choi stated "There is a problem though that the more I act, the more I become greedy for acting. What do I have to do from now on? Anyway, I want to remain as a good actor as I put more effort into managing myself"."

    On January 3, 2022, Choi was appointed as the new president of the Korean Broadcasting Actors Association.</p>
